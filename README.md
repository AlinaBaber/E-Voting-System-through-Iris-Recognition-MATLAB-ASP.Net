# E-Voting System through Iris Recognition (MATLAB & ASP.NET)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code for an **E-Voting System through Iris Recognition**, developed by **Alina Baber** in 2014. The system uses **iris recognition** technology for biometric authentication, enabling secure and tamper-proof online voting. 

The project was a significant milestone in demonstrating the potential of biometric technologies for secure voting systems. It was featured in **The Express Tribune** for its innovative approach to combining biometric security with online voting.

## Features:
- **Biometric Authentication**: The system uses iris recognition for voter authentication, ensuring a high level of security and preventing identity fraud.
- **Template Generation**: The system converts eye images into biometric templates (binary format) for comparison and authentication.
- **Matching Algorithm**: The system calculates **Hamming distance** to compare templates and verify voter identity.
- **Integration with ASP.NET**: The backend is integrated with ASP.NET for handling the voting process and ensuring secure submission of votes.

## Purpose:
The goal of this project was to create a secure and transparent online voting system that minimizes the risk of fraud and ensures that only authenticated individuals can cast their votes. The use of **iris recognition** ensures that the identity of each voter is accurately verified.

## Dataset Reference:
The system requires a dataset of eye images for biometric template generation and comparison. You can use the following publicly available datasets for testing:

- **Chinese Academy of Sciences Iris Image Database**:  
  This dataset contains a large collection of iris images for biometric research, and can be accessed here:

## Media Coverage:
This project was covered by **The Express Tribune**, recognizing it as an innovative application of **biometric technology** in the field of secure e-voting.

## Limitations:
- The code does not include functionality for **storing biometric templates** in a database or evaluating **match performance**. These features might be added in future versions.
- A **database of iris images** is required for testing the system. The dataset mentioned above is a great starting point for research and development.
